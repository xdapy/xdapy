Introduction
============

You are about to start a new experiment and are thinking about how to store the data that you are going to collect?

Xdapy is an abbreviation for **ex**\perimental **da**\ta in **Py**\thon and is designed to help you with data storage and retrieval. 
It allows to store the raw data and all the documentations and settings that are associated to the raw data. 

The goals of Xdapy are threefold:
    
First, researchers should spend their time pursuing their research question instead of wasting valuable 
resources in the organization of data.

Second, research should become more transparent and reproducible. 
Hereby a premise is that experimental data is documented in enough detail to be understandable from every researcher in the field. 

Third, to foster progress in science through meta-analyses and the reuse of data for other than the original research question, 
data needs to be well-documented. 

Xdapy facilitates a complete and consistent description of the data while at the same time it remains
adaptable for different experimental requirements.
It provides fast and easy data access for one or many users without storing redundant information
and without loosing information that may become important in future.

To use Xdapy you only need to know Python, follow the installation description and create your data model. 

Please be aware that Xdapy is not a completed project and is still being under development. 
Feel free to develop additional functionalities yourself or help with the documentation (see the :ref:`developer-information`)
